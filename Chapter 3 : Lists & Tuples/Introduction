Introduction to Lists and Tuples in Python âœ… 
Lists and Tuples are essential data structures in Python, used to store collections of items. Both are highly versatile but have distinct characteristics:

  Lists: Mutable (modifiable), ordered collections that can store items of any data type. They are represented using square brackets [].
  Tuples: Immutable (non-modifiable), ordered collections, represented using parentheses ().

This chapter explores the features, methods, and common operations associated with Lists and Tuples. You'll learn how to work with them effectively through practical examples and exercises.
