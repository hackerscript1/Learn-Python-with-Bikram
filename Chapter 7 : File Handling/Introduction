Introduction to Chapter 7 : File Handling in Python ✅ 
In this chapter, we will explore the essential concepts of file handling in Python, which allows you to interact with files on your system. File handling is a critical skill for developers, as it enables reading from and writing to files, allowing us to persist data for later use.

Python provides simple and efficient ways to perform various operations on files, such as:
  Reading from files: Extracting data stored in text or binary files.
  Writing to files: Saving data into files for future access or sharing.
  Appending to files: Adding new data without overwriting the existing content.
  Managing file operations safely: Using Python's with statement to automatically handle file closing, ensuring efficient memory use.

We will discuss the two main types of files you will encounter:
  Text Files: These are human-readable files such as .txt, .log, or .csv, where the data is stored in plain text format.
  Binary Files: These include multimedia files like .jpg, .png, .mp4, and .zip, where the data is stored in binary form.

Additionally, we will cover various file operations, including how to:
  Open and close files
  Read data from files in different ways
  Write and append data to files
  Handle file deletion
  Perform practical exercises to master these concepts

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of file handling in Python, enabling you to work with files in your programs efficiently. Whether you’re saving user input, processing log files, or managing data for a project, this knowledge will be crucial.

Let’s dive in and start working with files in Python!
