Chapter 4: Dictionaries and Sets in Python ✅ 
In this chapter, we dive into two of the most powerful and commonly used data structures in Python: Dictionaries and Sets. Both are essential tools for organizing, managing, and manipulating data effectively in Python.

Key Highlights of This Chapter
1. Dictionaries:
  A collection of key-value pairs where keys are unique.
  Perfect for scenarios where data needs to be accessed using unique identifiers.
  Example Use Case: Storing and accessing student details using their roll numbers as keys.

2. Sets:
  An unordered collection of unique elements.
  Useful for operations like finding common elements or removing duplicates.
  Example Use Case: Determining unique subjects from a list of subjects chosen by students.

What You Will Learn
  How to create and manipulate dictionaries and sets.
  Using built-in methods to perform common operations efficiently.
  Understanding the differences between mutable and immutable data structures.
  Practical examples and exercises to solidify your understanding.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a strong grasp of how to work with dictionaries and sets to solve real-world problems effectively.
