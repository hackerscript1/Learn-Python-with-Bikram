Chapter 5: Loops in Python âœ… 
In programming, loops are essential tools that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly, saving time and effort. Python provides two primary types of loops: while loops and for loops, each suited to different use cases.

This chapter will guide you through:
  How loops work in Python.
  Using while loops for conditional repetition.
  Using for loops for sequential traversal.
  Special control keywords like break, continue, and pass to manage loop execution.
  Practical examples and coding exercises to reinforce your understanding of loops in real-world scenarios.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to use loops effectively to handle repetitive tasks, traverse data structures, and solve complex problems with elegant and efficient code.
