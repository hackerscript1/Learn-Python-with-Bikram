Introduction to Functions and Recursion in Python âœ… 
In Python, functions are a fundamental concept that allow you to group related code into reusable blocks. Functions make programs more modular, readable, and easier to maintain by allowing you to write code that can be called multiple times with different inputs. Functions can accept parameters, return values, and help perform specific tasks efficiently.

In addition to basic functions, recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This method is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems, such as calculating factorials, traversing data structures, and more.

In this chapter, you will learn how to:
  Define and call functions.
  Use default parameters to make functions more flexible.
  Work with functions that perform mathematical calculations, manipulate lists, and handle common tasks.
  Understand and implement recursion to solve problems that require repetitive tasks or breaking down a problem into smaller tasks.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a strong grasp of how to use functions and recursion to improve the efficiency and organization of your Python code.
